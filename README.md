# WebSocket Examples for using Node.JS with SceneJS

The SceneJs.Socket node enables a server to dynamically participate in the construction,
destruction and configuration of its subgraph. It binds its subgraph to a WebSocket
through which it exchanges JSON message objects with a server, notifying the server of
events within its subgraph, while receiving incoming messages containing instructions to create,
delete and configure subnodes.

These are template examples to get you started. SceneJS WebSocket support is young - I'll extend
these examples as I figure out what it's meant to be.

* Compatible with SceneJS v0.7.6.1 and Node.js v0.1.91
* See Wiki page on SceneJS WebSocket node at http://scenejs.wikispaces.com/SceneJS.Socket
* Uses the Node.js WebSocket library at http://github.com/ncr/node.ws.js
